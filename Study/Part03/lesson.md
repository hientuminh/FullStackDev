# Overview
- Node.js and Express
- Deploying app to internet
- Saving data to MongoDB
- Validation and ESLint

# Note.js and Express
- Node.js uses so-called CommonJS instead of ES6
- Express: help your app when it grows in size
  - Transitive dependencies
  - semantic versioning
  - Update the dependencies by `npm update`
- nodemon: nodemon will watch the files in the directory in which nodemon was started, and if any files change, nodemon will automatically restart your node application.
- REST: RESTful API (GET /notes/10 , GET /notes, POST /notes, DELETE /notes/10, PUT /notes/10, PATCH /notes/10)
- Receiving data
